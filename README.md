Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Our goal is to implement 2 different machine learning models in order to classify, to the highest possible degree of accuracy, credit card fraud from a dataset gathered in Europe in 2 days in September 2013. After initial data exploration, we knew we would implement a logistic regression model and a k-means clustering model.
